NACLs are able to block all traffic that comes in to or out of the subnet but will not
block any traffic that passes within the subnet itself. All subnets are gathered within the
availability zone provided using the --availibility-zone flag. That empty NACL is
then applied to subnets previously gathered. After the duration period, given using the --duration flag,
the original NACLs are then re-applied to the subnets that were previously gathered
and the empty NACL is deleted.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// azCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// azCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
